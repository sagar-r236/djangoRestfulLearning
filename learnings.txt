  API VIEW 

----------------------------------------
An api view is a decorator (@api_view()) which makes the view of the djagno to api view.

To use this decorator we have to import it from rest_framework.decorators module

to respond in the json format we use Response() class then we pass in our data

Code Snippet:

from rest_framework.decorators import api_view #importing api_view decorator
from rest_framework.response import Response #importing Response class which we use to pass in our data 


@api_view(['GET']) #pass in a http method which the view performs in the form of a list
def index(request):
    courses = {
        'course_name' : 'Python',
        'learn' : ['Flask', 'Django', 'Fast Api'],
        'course_provider' : 'Someone'
    }

    return Response(courses)

We use request object passed inside the view to determine what method the request is making.
